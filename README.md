# Algorithms part 3 
## Lab 1
### Task 

- Create class Chainsaw with 3 atributes:
  - name
  - power_in_watt
  - rolls_per_minute
- Implement two sorting algorithms for two different Chainsaw class atributes:
  - quicksort for rolls_per_minute in ascending order
  - insertion sort for power_in_watt in descending order

### How-to-use instructions
- clone repository
- for reading from .csv file run command in console ```python main.py filename.csv```  
- or run ```python main.py```  and then enter file name in console
### Output  
In output you will be able to get such algorithm properties as:
- algorithm name
- execution time
- amount of swaps
- amount of comparisons
- result (list after sorting)
